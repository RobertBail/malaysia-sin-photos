      <h1>Rob B's Malaysia/Singapore Photos Feb 2025</h1>
      <h4>In February 2025, I went to Malaysia and Singapore for a week or so. These are mainly photos of Malaysia, some places/things I hadn't been to before in Malaysia, or since the January 2001 trip when I was 12. It was mainly a guy called Amir and his Chinese friend (I forget his name because I hadn't slept much for 2 or 3 days) who drove me over from Singapore and showed me around. Amir is/was aged 70 (?), retired from Malaysian Air Force, mainly as an aircraft mechanic he said, on C130 Hercules. He said in 1978 he was in RAAF Wagga Wagga, as part of an exercise or allied exchange/cooperation thing. The Chinese friend was aged 40 (?) and didn't speak as much English, but was pretty nice and showed me some of the temples, eg. the Chinese temple.</h4>

      <p>While at this mosque in Putrajaya, Amir introduced me to a woman, another guide/instructor, who discussed with me a few things about the architecture of the mosque, such as apparently small vents in the dome/ceiling of the mosque to let out hot air, an earlier form of air conditioning/ventilation I gather.</p>
